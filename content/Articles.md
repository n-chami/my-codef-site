# Summer must have

1. Shorts - I woud recommend flannels [unisex shorts](https://www.flannels.com/women/clothing/shorts#dcp=1&dppp=100&OrderBy=rank&Filter=AFLOR%5EUnisex%20Adults) as they are perfect for all activities from biking to just chilling on the beach

 2. Sunglasses - It is really up to you what you think suits your face but I believe round sunglasses are always a winner - click [here](https://www.expertreviews.co.uk/accessories/1407121/best-sunglasses-for-men-women-unisex) for a full range of options

 3. Sunscreen - No matter the colour of your skin or where you live, you should always wear [sunscreen](https://mahoneydermatology.com/5-important-reasons-to-wear-sunscreen-daily/#:~:text=Our%20skin%20works%20to%20protect,discoloration%2C%20and%20wrinkles%20over%20time.)

 4. Mini-fan - It wouldn't be a full list without this essential to keep yourself cool (other than water - remeber to stay hydrated!)

 5. Small travel bag - And last but not least, my favourite item. As you go on vacation or staycation you should always carry a small travel bag to carry essentials.
